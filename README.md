# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas, a Belgian software engineer passionate about building robust, maintainable systems. I love diving deep into problems, understanding the fundamentals, and crafting solutions that stand the test of time.

## What I do best

**Languages** (by experience):
- Go
- Java  
- JavaScript/TypeScript (backend focused)
- Bash
- C
- Python
- PHP

**Daily toolkit:**
- **Infrastructure**: Containerization, Serverless, Linux, Networking
- **Cloud**: AWS (primary), plus experience with GCP and Azure
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, with some DynamoDB experience
- **Integration**: RabbitMQ, 
- **Emerging tech**: Working with LLMs and AI tooling

## My approach

I prioritize building things that work reliably over chasing the latest trends. Whether it's debugging a tricky distributed system or designing a new service, I focus on understanding the problem deeply before jumping to solutions.

I actively use LLMs as coding assistants to accelerate my development workflow - from generating boilerplate code to exploring different approaches to complex problems. However, I remain a critical reviewer who personally writes all mission-critical sections and validates every AI-generated suggestion. This symbiotic relationship lets me focus my expertise where it matters, high level thinking, while delegating routine tasks. I believe this hybrid approach is the future of development, potentially doubling developer productivity as long as they stay experts in their field.
