# Hi

I'm Lucas, I'm a Belgian based software engineer and technologist. Making stuff that works, works well and stays working well is what I love to do. While prototyping is exiting I love the phase of software development where you throw away the prototype and start creating the actual thing. Diving deep, understanding, improving and tweaking is my passion. When I'm not developing for a living, I work on personal projects and delve into new (and old) technologies as much as possible.

## I believe in
* [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
* [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) 
* Since software runs the world I view software as a craft that should be performed by craftsman. Respecting quality over speed/quantity.
* Open sourcing everything!
* [TCP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc793)
* Life long learning
* [Linus's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law)

## I don't believe in
* [Cargo cult programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming)
* Agileâ„¢ (The monster that is monolithic Agile frameworks)

## Curriculum vitae for `grep` based HR
