# Hi

I'm Lucas, I'm a Belgian based software and devops engineer. I like to build stuff that works, works well and stays working well. Diving deep, understanding, improving and tweaking are my passions.

## I believe in
* [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
* [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) 
* Since software runs the world I view software as a craft that should be performed by craftsman. Respecting quality over speed/quantity.
* Open sourcing everything!
* [TCP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc793)/[IP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791)
* Life long learning
* > "Good design is as little design as possible." -- some German motherfucker on [motherfuckingwebsite](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/)
* > "Software engineering is programming integrated over time." -- Software Engineering At Google

## I don't believe in
* "Move fast and break things"
* [Cargo cult programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming)
* Agileâ„¢ (The monster that is monolithic Agile frameworks)
* Using Javascript/Python for everything
